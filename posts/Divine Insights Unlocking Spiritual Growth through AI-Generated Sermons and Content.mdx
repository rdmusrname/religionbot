As AI technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more  innovative and immersive ways to engage with religious teachings and deepen our spiritual connections. However,  it is crucial to navigate this convergence of technology and spirituality  with wisdom, ensuring that AI  serves as a tool for  spiritual growth rather than a replacement for human connection and divine wisdom.
